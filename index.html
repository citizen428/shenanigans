<p><strong>shenanigan</strong> (plural shenanigans):</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Trickery, games; skulduggery. To “call”, “claim” or “declare” shenanigans is to rhetorically label something as officially deceitful, improper, or otherwise incorrect. <em>“The advertisement said it would cost $50 but they charged me $75 at the register. I declare shenanigans.”</em> The speaker passes off the statement as having some sort of implied official effect, but in reality, it is simply a complaint.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A deceitful confidence trick, or mischief causing discomfort or annoyance. <em>You should learn to spot their shenanigans and avoid being fooled.</em></p>
</li><li>
<p>Mischievous play, especially by children.</p>
</li></ol>

<h2 id="label-Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Ruby Facets is the premiere collection of general purpose method extensions and standard additions for the Ruby programming language. This is not Ruby Facets though, so what you get is a random collection of methods I wrote because I found them interesting and/or useful. Some of them I actually also contributed to Facets, although sometimes they have different names or slightly different implementations.</p>

<h2 id="label-Installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Shenanigans can be installed via <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ gem install shenanigans
</code></pre>

<p>I only works on 1.9.3 and I generally only test it with the most current Ruby release.</p>

<h2 id="label-Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>If you really want the whole shebang, you can get it this way:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>shenanigans</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>Requiring a single method works as follows:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>shenanigans/&lt;class|module&gt;/&lt;method&gt;</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>Requiring all the extensions of a class or module also works:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>shenanigans/kernel</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="label-Contribute">Contribute</h2>

<p>If you have something you want to contribute to Shenanigans, you shoud reconsider and add it to Facets instead. This is a library for my own wonky ideas and I don&#39;t think it will ever see any real usage.</p>
