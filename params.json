{"name":"Shenanigans","tagline":"Like Facets, just not that useful.","body":"# Shenanigans\r\n\r\n*shenanigan* (plural shenanigans):\r\n\r\n1. Trickery, games; skulduggery. To \"call\", \"claim\" or \"declare\" shenanigans is to rhetorically label something as officially deceitful, improper, or otherwise incorrect. <em>\"The advertisement said it would cost $50 but they charged me $75 at the register. I declare shenanigans.\"</em> The speaker passes off the statement as having some sort of implied official effect, but in reality, it is simply a complaint.\r\n\r\n2. A deceitful confidence trick, or mischief causing discomfort or annoyance. <em>You should learn to spot their shenanigans and avoid being fooled.</em>\r\n\r\n3. Mischievous play, especially by children.\r\n\r\nSource: [Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shenanigan#English)\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nRuby Facets is the premiere collection of general purpose method\r\nextensions and standard additions for the Ruby programming language. This is not Ruby Facets though, so what you get is a random collection of methods I wrote because I found them interesting and/or useful. Some of them I actually also contributed to Facets, although sometimes they have different names or slightly different implementations.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nShenanigans can be installed via [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/).\r\n\r\n  $ gem install shenanigans\r\n\r\nI only works on 1.9.3 and I generally only test it with the most current Ruby release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIf you really want the whole shebang, you can get it this way:\r\n\r\n    require 'shenanigans'\r\n\r\nRequiring a single method works as follows:\r\n\r\n    require 'shenanigans/<class|module>/<method>'\r\n\r\nRequiring all the extensions of a class or module also works:\r\n\r\n    require 'shenanigans/kernel'\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nIf you have something you want to contribute to Shenanigans, you shoud reconsider and add it to Facets instead. This is a library for my own wonky ideas and I don't think it will ever see any real usage.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\nThis project was created by Michael Kohl.
